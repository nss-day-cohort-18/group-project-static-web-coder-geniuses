	    <h3>Our History<h3>
	    	<p>From all different places in the universe, to a small software school in Nashville, Tenessee. The journey that began in January 2017 with four ice cream lovers, coder geniuses and science experts.</p>
	    	<br>
	    <h5>A little about ourselves</h5>
	    	<p>Justin: Loves to travel the country in his jeep. His favorite activites include hiking, coding, and eating his favorite ice cream 'Wild N Reckless'. Currently Justin is working on an application called the 'OoOozing App' it will pop out ice cream instantly out of a devices screen.
	    	</p>
	    	<br>
	    	<p>Angela: Comes from a different world similar to ours, but also different in many ways. She grew up in space and she is our NASA ice cream genius coder. What makes our ice cream special are secret ingredients that Angela brings from space. When shes not working, she enjoys visiting her friend and family in space and feeding them lots of ice cream.
	    	</p>	
	    	<br>
	    	<p>Will: The brains and science that goes behind all of our ice cream making is credited to will. He graduated Gelato University with a Phd. He is the true master of ice cream. When Will is not in his labratory experimenting, he enjoys hacking into google and facebook, playing hockey and running ice-cream-athons. 
	    	</p>
	    	<br>
	    	<p>Miriam: The true diva that brings it all together! She gets her inspirations and skills from motivational ice cream speakers and ice cream festivals. When Miriams not creating ice cream, she is playing with her pug (Charlie) and trying to catch up on JavaScript. She currently is working on dog safe ice cream treats.
